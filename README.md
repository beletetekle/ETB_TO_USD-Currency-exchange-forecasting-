# ETB_TO_USD-Currency-exchange-forecasting-
This Project is to forecast Ethiopian Birr to USD exchange rate forecasting. I have used Linear regression for this project but linear regression is not recommended for this kind of time series data(because I use previous days rate to forecast the future rate).  


Introduction 

Foreign Exchange rate (ForEx rate) is one of the most important means through which a country’s relative level of economic health is determined. A country's foreign exchange rate provides a window to its economic stability, which is why it is constantly watched and analyzed. It's all peoples(from merchant to ordinary people) want to know how will be the exchange rate of our Birr to the other countries. The exchange rate is defined as "the rate at which one country's currency may be converted into another.”  For this project, we only consider USD since its the widely used currency in the world. ( it will be straight forward to forecast for the other if needed, it only require changing one column data from USD to any currency rate). Even-though there are many indirect factors that affect currency exchange rate, we only consider the direct factors. 8 Key direct Factors that Affect Foreign Exchange Rates are :
      Inflammation rates 
      Interest rates 
      Country’s Current Account / Balance of Payment
      Government Debt
      Terms of Trade
      Political Stability & Performance
      Recession
      Speculation

Algorithm to be employed
